### Description

Update: Ver 1.0.1 29 Feb. 2008

Drop modTVpropbag.bas into your project and you can save and restore treeviews with 2 simple calls. This is as close to "plug-n-play" as it gets... even a very new newbie can make this work in minutes.

I include a demo project for your perusal.

Supports multiple treeviews (easily modified to work with other controls). Saves and restores:

Nodes/child nodes, Node.Key, Node.Tag, Icons, Expanded state, sorted state, checked state. What else could you want for nothin'?

Version 1.0.1 implements the .tag property (per request) and is considerably cleaner/optimized code.

Appreciate your comments most.
